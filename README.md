# spring-kotlin-web

Web utilities for Kotlin with Spring Boot.

## Release

see https://github.com/mbogner/spring-boot-bom for more details.

For example this prepares a release of 1.0.0 and a development version of 1.0.1-SNAPSHOT.
Do NOT run it with the sample versions. This needs to be updated on every run.

```shell
./gradlew release -Prelease.useAutomaticVersion=true -Prelease.releaseVersion=1.0.0 -Prelease.newVersion=1.0.1-SNAPSHOT
```

You can skip `-Prelease.releaseVersion=1.0.0 -Prelease.newVersion=1.0.1-SNAPSHOT` to release the snapshot and
autoincrement.
